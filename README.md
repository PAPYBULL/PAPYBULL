As a Bachelor student in Electronics, I had the intention to assemble a quadcopter starting from a Holybro X500 kit but I was faced to several problems.
Here is the last problem that I would like to submit to the Community->

Measuring the deadzone
After carrying out the ESC calibration according to “All-at-once” method, I proceeded to the testing of my quadrotor vehicle. That trial revealed that one of the four motors doesn’t start at the same time than the others. Therefore, it seemed obvious that the corresponding ESC was subject to a dead zone which should be measured and suppressed as recommended in Arducopter’s documentation.
According to those instructions i.e., Arducopter >First Time Setup>Mandatory Hardware Configuration>Setting Motor Range, one should refer to Mission Planner's Initial Setup (which goes beyond the scope of Arducopter).
After opening the page and selecting the Optional Hardware menu, a Motor Test submenu was supposed to appear, at the bottom of the list, to check the characteristics of the 4 motors A, B, C, D.
Unfortunately, this Motor Test submenu did not appear, in my case! Why?
Consequently, the dead zone problem cannot be solved by that way in my case! What do you suggest?
